/* Notes related to PHP version:

   Pass-By-Reference has been deprecated since PHP 4.0.6 (included).

   Your PHP server may raise warning like this:

       "Warning: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated;"
   
   If the line of code shown in the error message on your page refers to 
   the line in this file with the following statement:

		"while($temp = odbc_fetch_into($res, $idata)){"

   It means that you have to change your dbQwikSite options and change
   the  'Generate Pass By Reference' option. You can access this option
   via 'Tools -> Project Settings, then look at the 'PHP Options' tab.
   Switch the check box called "Generate function calls using "Pass by reference"
